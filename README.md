# Satellite-Imagery
Satellite image processing is an important area of 
research now a days due to its wide range of applications. 
Researchers and scientists have paid attention to satellite 
image processing so as to capture information from them. 
Satellite image analysis poses a great challenge to the 
researchers due to high variability, low resolution and big data 
of the satellite images. A lot of work has been done for satellite
image analysis that covers the research from classification of 
hand crafted features to applying high performance computing 
on satellite images. The researchers have achieved great 
success in satellite image analysis. But a systematic review, 
which will lead researchers to identify the problem and to 
contribute in this field, is missing. In the presented chapter, an 
attempt has been made to present a detailed review of the 
various steps of satellite image processing, classification and 
available databases. This chapter will give an impetus towards 
further research in this field and will provide a baseline to 
research in the field of satellite image processing.

Image segmentation can be accomplished in a number of 
ways. Each approach is affected differently by various 
factors. The following section reviews about some of the 
techniques and approaches used for image segmentation.
Based on the approach, image segmentation can be 
classified into the following categories:
- Region Based
- Edge Based
- Threshold Based
